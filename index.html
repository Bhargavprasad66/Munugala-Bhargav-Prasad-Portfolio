									<h1>HR Analytics<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Built an end-to-end HR analytics pipeline using Power BI and SQL to analyze employee lifecycle data. Data was gathered from HRMS, surveys, and performance records. Applied data munging techniques to clean and standardize over 10,000 records. Used SQL queries for segmentation, correlation, and clustering analysis on factors affecting attrition—such as location, department, compensation bands, and engagement levels.

Created predictive attrition models and visualizations to help HR identify “at-risk” employees. Recommended interventions based on model outputs and trend forecasts, helping the organization shift from reactive to proactive retention planning.

Tools Used: SQL, Power BI, Excel, Azure AI (for cloud-based model testing), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modeling.</p>

									<h1>Healthcare Analytics<br />
									</h1>Executed an end-to-end healthcare analytics project using SQL and Power BI to analyze over 50,000 patient records from hospital databases. Focused on identifying patterns in readmission rates, emergency visits, and length of stay. Used SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for building dynamic dashboards used by hospital management.

Performed correlation analysis between diagnosis types, treatment delays, and patient outcomes. Created visual models to detect bottlenecks in patient discharge workflows. Insights were used to optimize staffing and reduce overcrowding in emergency departments.

Key Outcomes:
	•	Reduced average length of stay by 1.2 days in high-traffic departments
	•	Enabled early identification of patients at risk of readmission using trend analysis .</p>

									</h1> Executed a banking analytics project aimed at improving customer retention, credit risk assessment, and operational efficiency. Worked with real-world banking datasets involving customer demographics, transaction history, loan performance, and product usage patterns. Used Power BI and SQL to create interactive dashboards that visualized customer segmentation, loan default trends, and branch-wise performance.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify high-risk customers and detect fraudulent transactions based on spending behavior. Developed KPI dashboards to monitor metrics like customer lifetime value (CLV), loan delinquency rate, NPA ratio, and cross-sell opportunities.

Collaborated with stakeholders to translate data insights into actionable strategies, such as personalized product recommendations, improved credit scoring models, and targeted marketing for high-value clients.
